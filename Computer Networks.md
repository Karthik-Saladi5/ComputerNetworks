### Fault Tolearance:

the ability to:
    
1. Continue working despite failures
2. Ensure no loss of service


### Scalability:

the ability to:

1. Grow based on the needs
2. Have good performance after growth
   
### Quality of Service (QoS)

the ability to:

1. Set Priorities
2. Manage data traffic to reduce data loss, delay etc., 

### Security

the ability to prevent:

1. Unauthorized access
2. Misuse
3. Forgery

the ability to provide:

1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Availability
